# Selenium Test Automation Project – To-Do List Application

## Repository
Frontend App: https://github.com/santshvm/ToDoList

This repository contains a suite of automated test cases developed using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG in Java, targeting a custom-built To-Do List web application. The purpose of this project is to verify key functionalities through automated UI tests and demonstrate end-to-end testing using a clean and modular structure.


## Test Scenarios Covered

- Add Task – Adds a new item and verifies it is displayed in the list.

- Delete Task – Removes an existing item from the list and verifies it no longer exists.

- Mark Task as Complete – Simulates checking a task as completed and validates checkbox state.

- Filter Tasks (Active / Completed / All) – Tests the UI filter functionality to display tasks based on status.

- Date Heading Validation – Confirms that the current date is correctly rendered in the UI header.

## Technology Stack

- Language: Java

- Automation: Selenium WebDriver

- Testing Framework: TestNG

- Build Tool: Maven

- Execution Config: testng.xml
